What this is is something i worked on for a class project. This is a hangman game with these features:

1. The game allows you to pick the max word length before you start
2. The player entering the letter enters a one word hint of what they entered for the other players
3. just before you begin, the program prints out a random good luck statement out of a predetermined array of five statements.
4. Theres a live model that updates for each time the user guesses a word incorrectly.

While I may turn in the game in this form, I am not entirely done with it. I will continue to try and iron out a couple of things and add a couple more features.
